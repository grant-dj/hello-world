# hello-world
My hello word repository that I have created by following the Git tutorial page.
I am doing this tutorial while attending a business meeting. I am listening intently to the business meeting and contributing to ideas and decisions, but am looking to also 'do something' while this long meeting is running.
My internet connectivity has dropped-out a few times in the last half hour, but hasn't stopped me from continuing through the tutorial (and while also contributing to the business meeting).
I will stop adding to this branch and look to follow the next step in ths tutorial.
